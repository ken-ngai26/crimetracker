CrimeTracker:
One Paragraph of projecVPD CrimeTracker is an application for reporting community disorder. The application will be based on the IOS system used on the iPhone. It will provide different kinds of disorder reports in categories such as Graffiti, Suspected Drug House, and Suspected Stolen Vehicle. Users will be able to attach photos, write a textual description, and provide their location via GPS or manual input for a disorderly report. If a user composes a report and does not have an internet connection, or does not wish to send it, there will be an option to save the report as a draft until they decide to send it. This application can be used by the public, and by patrol volunteers working with community policing organizations. The simplicity of this application means that it will be accessible to a wide variety of community members.t description goes here
